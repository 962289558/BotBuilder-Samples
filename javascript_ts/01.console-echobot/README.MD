This sample shows how to create a simple echo bot that you can talk to from the console.

# To try this sample
- Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-samples.git
    ```
- In a terminal, navigate to javascript_ts/01.console-echobot
    ```bash
    cd javascript_ts/01.console-echobot
    ```
    - Point to the MyGet feed 
    ```bash
    npm config set registry https://botbuilder.myget.org/F/botbuilder-v4-js-daily/npm/
    ```
- Install modules and start the bot
    ```bash
    npm i & npm start
    ```
- To reset registry, you can do
    ```bash
    npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/
    ```

# Testing the bot 
After running `npm start`, the bot presents a prompt directly in the console window.

Send messages to the bot by typing them into the console.  The bot will echo your message back to you.

# Adapters
Adapters such as the `ConsoleAdapter` provide an abstraction for your bot to work with a variety of environments and messaging platforms.

The adapter is responsible for directing incoming and outgoing communication, authentication, and so on. Adapters for different platforms and
messaging technologies differ internally, but achieve the same goal - connecting bots to a stream of messages and events from users. 
When your bot receives an Activity, the adapter wraps up everything about that Activity, creates a [context object](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js/blob/master/doc/botbuilder/classes/botbuilder.turncontext.md), passes it to your bot's application logic,
and sends responses generated by your bot back to the user.

In this example, we're using the `ConsoleAdapter`, which provides a way to exchange messages - they're sent and received via the console. It also allows you to build and test bots that operate on your local machine without any external API calls or client applications.

Other available adapters connect your bot to the web, or through the BotFramework Connector Service, to many popular messaging platforms.
