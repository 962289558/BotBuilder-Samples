# Concepts introduced in this sample
## What is a bot?
A bot is an app that users interact with in a conversational way using text, graphics (cards), or speech. It may be a simple question and answer dialog,
or a sophisticated bot that allows people to interact with services in an intelligent manner using pattern matching,
state tracking and artificial intelligence techniques well-integrated with existing business services.
## Attachments
